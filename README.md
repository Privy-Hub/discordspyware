Discord receives government requests. No plans on adding E2E Encryption any time soon.

Discord has raised $279.3 million dollarsand it has to return on this investment. (which is more than 279.3 million dollars that has to be paid back).

If Discord is not able to satisfy it's obligation to it's investors, it has a third option- selling user information to advertisers. Discord is already datamining it's users to produce it's recommendation system,[8] which means that it is already turning it's userbase into extremely valueble, sellable, advertising data. Discord has 130 million users[7], and it can produce a statistical model of what games each user (who does not opt-out of advertising) owns, plays, and wants to buy. This is incredibly valueble information that Discord can sell if it cannot reach it's profit obligations with it's current revenue model. If Discord is a successful games store, then it wont need to do this. But if Discord gets in financial trouble, it probably will be forced to liquiate this asset. 

"Discord does receive government requests for user data. We're working on publishing our first Transparency Report. We're a small team, so it may take some time, but rest assured that transparency to our users is something we value."

They have refused to add E2E Encryption even with 4,500 users voting for it.

Only Voice is end-to-end encrypted. Chat (even DMs) do not have any kind of E2E.

proof that it record your process and act just like a malware if not worse.
 That the process logging features of Discord are now being recorded on Discord's servers as a form of telemetry (spyware), and removes speculation about why this feature exists. It is clarified by Discord that this spyware feature is used for advertising to it's users.This means that Discord is recording the programs you have open to build a statistical model of what programs you might buy/lisence in the future. They are also scanning shared memory segment, grabbing your dom, cookies and history.

The Discord Incident

discord is spyware 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg9uhitYsTc

https://hooktube.com/watch?v=QN_6AZT92pU
DATA-MINING:It is highly likely that discord is data-mining to generate revenue for the service, although this is unconfrmed.  The frst, direct indicator for this can be found within discord’s source code.  Within the javascript found on the web version of the client, Google API keys forgeo-location have been found in plaintext.  Locating users geographically is an important part of data-mining, and is needed to separate users by region.The next big indicator of data-mining practices can be found within the discord TOS.  Inolder versions of the document, Discord made statements that the company could transfer data to third “related” parties.  The TOS has since been updated without such a statement.  It is unknown if this update was made due to previous accusations of data mining or was simply due to changing needs.It is also worth noting that the main founder of Discord, Jason Citron,was caught up in a data-mining scandal with a previous company known as OpenFeint.  It is unknown if it was Citron’s initial intent to make money through data mining, however if it was, this would createa clear pattern of creating social networks for gamers to gather and sell data.While it is highly likely that data-mining is Discord’s primary revenue source, all evidence leading to this conclusion is circumstantial.  More information is needed before a defnitive yes or no can be made.  A possible route to proving this defnitively could lie in its previous investors.  Discord cannot sell the data on its own, and needs a third party with existing customers to purchase the data.  Outright sale of information as Discord (or Hammerand Chisel, Discord’s parent company) would be detrimental to their image.SECURITY ISSUES:Discord’s improper implementation has led to serious problems in the past, turning small vulnerabilities into large exploits allowing attackers control of victim’s computers.  These problems primarily stem from the application’s use of Electron.js.  Electron is a framework used to turn node.js programs and html interfaces into full applications that can be deployed cross platform.  This is done through a pairing of the blink engine (from chrome) and a node.js interpreter.  A slight problem arises from this.  Javacript from outside sources displayed within electron is executed as node.js code unless displayed through a webview tag.In no place within Discord is webview used to pad areas where user input is displayed.  Should an xss vulnerability be found within the application, user machines can be exploited atthe system level, rather than in the sandboxed environment of the web browser.  Xss vulnerabilities have been found and patched in the application (most notably one involving the data: uri).  It appears that Discord is aware of this problem, and has created a bug bounty system in an attempt to catch new faws and minimize damage.  However this will only do them so much good.  Others have discovered discord’s faws, and sales of xss vulnerabilities may have occurred in secret (damagelab).BAD BUSINESS PRACTICE:While it has not been well documented, Discord has been using ethically questionable marketing tactics to bring discord to the public’s eye.  The core marketing strategy has always been paid promotion from youtube personalities, mainly in the gaming sector.  In an attempt to build a userbase, the company paid youtubers to make discord channels and instructed them on how exactly to talk about the application.Later, the company started a “hypesquad” system, giving kickbacks to users who promoted the product to friends.  Members of hypesquad are encouraged to coordinate events, and receive boxes of Discord branded items to distribute.  In return, those who advertise discord get a special member status.  This advertising strategy is very lucrative, using people to advertise by word of mouth at little to no risk or cost CURRENT SITUATION:DISCORD:Discord views the right wing as a detriment to their platform, bringing them bad press coverage, and possibly scaring away investors.  It has shown a willingness to ban and delete servers with right wing discussion.  Its discovery of these servers appears to be done exclusively through user submitted reports as well as communication from anti-right wing groups.  When banning a server, the platform tends to delete the server and suspend the accounts of the moderators and admins, leaving all others alone.  It is not believed that discord looks through the personal chatlogs of the users it bans, or their chatlogs on other servers.  Through the beginning of the ban spree, many moderators of servers were banned leaving other servers they started still open but without an owner.UNICORN RIOT:After the events of Charlottesville in 2017, Unicorn Riot published an expose on their website showing logs from a planning server.  After this, Unicorn Riot began to publish numerous other leaks relating to Discord.  Unicorn Riot obtains its information primarily through infltration.  To log the chats in mass, the group uses the Discord History Tracker tool distributed by Daniel Chylek.  It is not believed that Daniel works with Unicorn Riot or even has knowledge of their use of his tool.  Unicorn Riot seems to have limited technical abilities.  Their website is hosted via a paid wordpress instance.  The discordleaks site is custom built on a rocket framework, implying the work of an ameture.The group also currently faces problems with information overload.  In one statement the group stated that they had 50-60 Discord servers to examine.  The logs can reach anywhere from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of messages.  With little technical skill to speed up the process and limited staff, analysis of this data has screeched toa halt.  Analysis of Discord chat logs has become a resource sink for the group.SPLC:The SPLC has obtained information from right wing Discord chats in the past, and is working with Discord to help eliminate people from the platform.  This is the beginning and the end of all knowledge regarding cooperation between these two groups.  Speculation has long been made that Discord is giving chat logs to the SPLC, although there is no evidence at this time to confrm such an exchange.

Discord is backed by venture capitalist companies. These venture capitalist companies have invested over $9,000,000 into the company behind Discord. I am sure if you know what a venture capitalist firm is, you already will hate Discord. Venture capitalist firms generally target IT startups to hand the company startup costs, etc. In exchange the venture capitalist firm has equity. Let's say that Discord gets everything up and running for about $3,000,000 and then they sell it for $80,000,000 to some Japanese company. Discord original founders pull all support, they collect their fat paycheck and walk away.

https://gizmodo.com/5028459/aurora-feint-iphone-app-delisted-for-lousy-security-practices
~THEY READ YOUR DEVICE ID! I have my reasons because the guy got sued and that's enough evidence for me to not use it! I hate reposting links.
https://www.google.com/amp/www.adweek.com/digital/openfeint-lawsuit-gree/amp/
So this is my honest opinion, the future of Jason Citron's apps, well just simply answers it for me. I posted numerous of postings, but these are more legit sources that show it to be true. Apple found the mistake and shut it down!

First of all, Aurora Feint was a game that Jason Citron helped create for iOS devices. With an interest in making big money. Their application would dig into your cellphone contact list and send all of your contact information to their servers without encryption.
Discord secretly raised ~$50M led by Index Ventures, along with Institutional Venture Partners and previous investors Spark Capital, Benchmark and Greylock Partners. How can you pay the funds back off of nothing? SELLING YOUR DATA!

Like most free to use apps, the key to the riches is in collecting user data.

Discord can collect anonymous data to analyse and predict future trends, or sell these info to marketers. You people really need to understand what a venture capitalists does!

Citron was just 26 years old when he and Cassley sold OpenFeint, their social platform for mobile games, to GREE, a social networking service, in 2011 for $104 million.

classactionlawsuitsinthenews.com/class-action-lawsuit-complaints/openfeint-green-international-privacy-class-action-lawsuit-complaint/

In April 2011, Japanese company GREE, Inc. bought OpenFeint for US$104 million.

01/GAMEBRIDGE. Revenue Potential: SaaS for Developers (third-party)
02/STREAMKIT. Revenue Potential: Revenue sharing/3rd party app integration/Steam competitor (third-party)
03/GAME REVENUE SHARING. Revenue Potential: Game sales revenue sharing/Steam competitor (third-party)
04/NITRO (NO ONE HARDLY USES IT-HAD SO MANY SECURITY ISSUES)
05/ADVERTISING (MEANING YOU!)

Wondering how we’ll make money? In the future there will be optional cosmetics like themes, sticker packs, and sound packs available for purchase. We’ll never charge for Discord’s core functionality-QUOTE DISCORD

Also merchandise clothing. Really?

Are they really making that much off game revenue? SIMPLY DATA REVENUE!

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES!

Revenue by data. DATA!

I suggest you try to avoid all third-party and make it so simple based for yourself. It will add up of lost for Discord. Also I don't think many people use it as such, so technically I'm quite accurate.

So what's the verdict? Be careful when using Discord! I don't care if you still use it, I'm just stating this is Discord's revenue!

Data anonymization is a type of information sanitation whose intent is privacy protection. It is the process of either encrypting or removing personally identifiable information from data sets, so that the people whom the data describe remain anonymous. However, you're technically responsible for anything you post, as stated in the ToS and/or PrivacyPolicy; so who knows? So any game revenue, there is your personal information involved, which they lie to you. Using Cassandra is quite the data mine! If your read Discord's TOS/PrivacyPolicy, it's quite contradicting. Even on reddit they have mention they don't share personal information because of lawyers, meaning they have dealt with it before, but still they do the same procedures for their revenue, just like AuoraFeint and OpenFeint.

In 2011, OpenFeint was party to a class action suit with allegations including computer fraud, invasion of privacy, breach of contract, bad faith and seven other statutory violations. According to a news report "OpenFeint's business plan included accessing and disclosing personal information without authorization to mobile-device application developers, advertising networks and web-analytic vendors that market mobile applications". The class action suit was later voluntarily dismissed.

It's like he sold it and let them deal with it. What a dirt! Like seriously why hasn't this got soaked in your brains?

On November 16, 2012, GREE announced that it would be discontinuing the service on December 14, 2012, primarily in favor of its own similar platform.

Smart move Jason Citron, smart move!

My conclusion stops here. If Discord gets sold in a few more years, then I know I'm right. March 6, 2015 It's not that old. I don't know what will happen in a few years. October 2001; 15 years ago is Teamspeak.

Here's my thoughts by year gap

-OpenFeint-February 17, 2009
-In April 2011, Japanese company GREE, Inc. bought OpenFeint for US$104 million
-On November 16, 2012, GREE announced that it would be discontinuing the service on December 14, 2012

-July 7, 2008-Aurora Feint
-All versions of Aurora Feint have been removed from AppStore since July 14, 2012 because of the leaks of security.

https://r4p3.net/threads/what-is-discord.861/

These are actual sources and just how it adds up, makes me not want to use Discord.


Discord explicitly confirms in its privacy policy[1] that it collects the following information:
Discord receives government requests for your information

Discord has confirmed in an email correspondence[6] that it does receive government requests for information. So, we know that the government potentially has access to all of the information that Discord collects about you. You can read a copy of the email image posted in the source here in case the link there dies. 
IP Address

Device UUID

User's e-mail address

All text messages

All images

All VOIP data (voice chat)

Open rates for e-mail sent by Discord

*All of this information is literally embedded within their TOS, but more info on a free hosted website here, with citations:

https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord.html
 The implications of this information can be broken down like this: By recording your IP address, Discord can track your general location (about as precise as which county you are in). Discord can also tell which devices you use, as it uniquely identifies each device, and how much you use those devices, as it can record your device usage habits (since Discord is usually open in the background so that it can receive messages). Discord also records every single interaction you have with other users through its service. This means that Discord is confirmed to log every conversation that you have through Discord, and record everything that you say on Discord, and view all images that you send through Discord. Therefore, none of your interactions on Discord are private. Discord's privacy policy also contains several occurrences of phrases such as "including but not limited to," which is an explicit confirmation that Discord contains more spyware features that are not disclosed to the user.
Discord contains features which allow integration with other spyware platforms

In light of the TOS update regarding class action lawsuits etc... This seems important. The owner of Discord made an app like Discord in the past called "OpenFeint" and sold it to a Japanese company who bought it for the user information. They were sued in a class action lawsuit.

    Mods continue to claim that they are not removing my posts or my information that I post so I'm adding the proof that they are to the bottom of this thread.

I've been asked a lot where this information comes from. I remember it better because I was around when it happened but it's harder to find the info now. Here are some links I dug up about it.

Take note that Citron did not actually LEAVE the company until after the lawsuits.

OpenFeint had over 70 million users at the time it was sold to GREE, a Japanese company, who summarily deactivated the app.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFeint (In 2011, OpenFeint was party to a class action suit with allegations including computer fraud, invasion of privacy, breach of contract, bad faith and seven other statutory violations. According to a news report "OpenFeint's business plan included accessing and disclosing personal information without authorization to mobile-device application developers, advertising networks and web-analytic vendors that market mobile applications")

Citron also went into business with Tencent...

    https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/10/fates-forever-maker-hammer-chisel-raises-additional-funding-from-tencent-benchmark/

    https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-02-11-jason-citrons-hammer-and-chisel-raises-undisclosed-funding-from-tencent

He made a game with that funding called "Fates Forever," a mobile moba that failed. In this same article they detail how Discord received over 70 million in funding from outside sources (after Citron stated he wanted Discord to be independent.)

    https://www.businessinsider.com/discord-ceo-jason-citron-interview-2017-7

Citron also stated in interviews that Discord was an independent thing and he wanted to keep it independent but he received 20 million in funding from "Greylock" and made a Greylock employee part of the board for Discord, even though he made over 100 million from selling OpenFeint.

Just remember... if you're not paying for it, you're not the customer, you're the product being sold.

--------- Mods removing my posts and claiming that Reddit is doing it ----------

From this thread. Notice only places where I post an image of the conversation with the mod or respond about them removing my stuff... The RED are posts that were removed.

Previously they told me in a message that they "fixed" my posts and now they would show up. I looked for this topic and it was nowhere to be found. Several people confirmed. Not searchable, did not exist. After confronting them AGAIN, they were like, oh it's there... Obviously allowing it through once enough people started realizing what they were doing.

Reasons not to use the Discord communications system

    The Discord communications system requires running a nonfree client program. That alone is reason to refuse to use it.

    The program reportedly collects lots of data about users.
    The developer denies the claim that Discord reports which processes are running on the user's machine. I have no way of determining the facts about this specific point. Whether it collects those particular data is a minor detail; I mention it only to avoid appearing to assert a criticism that might not be true.

    For the same reason, I mention that selling personal data is not the sole way that the company makes money.
    I don't think that question how it makes money really matters. What matters, ethically, is what the software does to users. The developers' motives for making it do those things are pertinent to understanding the situation but should not affect our moral judgment of mistreatment of users.

    I would appreciate suggestions of other pages to use as factual references for specific wrongs committed by Discord, or to correct on a trustworthy basis any false accusations in the page linked to above.

The Discord web site also offers application nonfree programs. You shouldn't use them, naturally, but they are a separate issue from using the communications system itself. 

Proofs keep getting attacked by discord, video taken down from youtube 
I mirrored the images at the bottom on to my site, if the imgur links get deleted, you can use these.
It's the same guy that owns Discord.


It got flagged numerous time by anti-virus infact if you compare it features to a malware or trojan it's exactly the same.

I'm surprised you missed that OpenFeint got sued.

Yes it should be disturbing, because all this information makes it seem legitimate. I hope you learned something! Learn to appreciate people that know common sense with the world around them. I might seem arrogant, but really I'm just aware by researching the history. It's not like you would, but seriously anyone can exploit themselves and anyone going by third-party will get solicitation. This absolutely kills me! Discord doesn't own discord.com, but owns discordapp.com; that looks bad for a company. They should off named the app to something besides Discord, avoid bad appearances by other domains that release malware. Also they say they can share information with affiliates. http://hammerandchisel.com/privacy/ So the policy changes by hammer&chisel and they say that they can share any information among basically anyone, meaning advertisers. https://hired.com/company/hammer-chisel-discord
Testing should be limited to sites and services that Discord directly operates. We will not accept reports for third-party services or providers that integrate with Discord through our APIs. They don't accept third-party reports, when they make profit from them by sharing revenue....WHAT?! They should deal with all reports! Yeah be careful on what you post! This is unprofessional!
